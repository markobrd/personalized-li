        "post_text": "\n We will all have different visceral reactions to hearing Bill Gates call jobs an \u201cartifact of the shortage\u201d; and when he says \u201cit\u2019s very hard to imagine this future\u201d, that\u2019s likely an understatement that will likely also mean different things to all of us.\n\nThe man who technically owns this wonderful platform of LinkedIn plus Microsoft, but also in his ~$200B networth holds significant positions in both FedEx and UPS, both John Deere and Caterpillar Inc., as well as Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts., Walmart, Coca-Cola FEMSA, Ecolab, PACCAR (yes, EVs), AutoNation, Berkshire Hathaway as well as investments into real estate, agriculture, my new space (the \u201cspace space\u201d) through Breakthrough Energy Ventures) (also: Reynolds American Inc. \u201cbig tobacco\u201d and Procter & Gamble) BUT:\n\nnothing in the Universal Basic Income (UBI) space yet.\n\nI\u2019d like to personally call on \u201cUncle Bill\u201d to commit to deploy 7% of all bottom-line revenue across his portfolio OF INCREASED PROFITS DUE TO DISPLACEMENT OF HUMAN LABOR CAPITAL - aka \u201chumans\u2019 jobs\u201d.\n\nTo clarify, this 7% (a form of \u201cUniversal Basic Compute\u201d) would ONLY be on revenue that came from work that used to be done by humans being paid to do it, but now displaced by A.I. automation, agents, robots, etc.\n\nMr. Gates has been spending a lot of time and attention in and on India \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3 lately, which I personally love \u2014 but India, dispite being both the most populace country and also the world\u2019s fastest growing economy, is a PRIME EXAMPLE of somewhere where UBI is most needed (much like here in Brazil \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddf7).\n\nContemporaries of his like Sam Altman and even the divisive Elon Musk have worked on and discussed UBI (I believe that at least Sam actually means it too, and his World f/ Worldcoin project has made strides), vocally urged humanity and corporates to embrace UBI, and even Bill Gates recognizes in recent Netflix documentary \u201cWhat\u2019s Next\u201d that UBI projects will be needed, could work and could \u201cactually save money in the long run\u201d.\n\nThat concept and \u2018mantra\u2019 is one he and his mentor Warren Buffet take very, very seriously \u2014 and in fact, there are some brilliant business models around UBI.\n\nAlso, in over 100 pilots of UBI in Finland \ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddee, Brazil, India, USA \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 and many more, Mental Health issues almost always get reduced by over 90% and populations as well as individuals typically get more productive.\n\nThe time to discuss and get all this right is NOW. Thanks, \u201cUnc.\u201d, for opening up like this at The Indian Express Adda. Let\u2019s keep the dialogue open and flowing!\n\nComment and share and tag Bill Gates to encourage him to accept this opportunity to be on the right side of history. 7% bottom line of displaced payroll from his holdings would translate to thousands of dollars for households and individuals monthly as we eek closer to a post-labor economy; then we can encourage Google, IBM, Siemens, Tata Group, Apple, Meta and all others to follow suit.\n\nhashtag#ubi hashtag#tec",
