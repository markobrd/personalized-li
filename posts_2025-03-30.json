Promotions and raises are suddenly \"not in the budget.\"2) Isolation & Exclusion:\u21b3 Colleagues start keeping their distance. Key meetings happen without them. Social invites? Gone.3) Increased Scrutiny:Every decision is second-guessed. \u21b3 Every task is picked apart. The goal?

Prioritize NatureNature's been my biggest mentor and therapist.Getting outside daily, taking my shoes off, and grounding myself has brought infinite stability to my life.2. Never Stop Building Your NetworkOver the years, I've created a personal Board of Advisors.Some of my closest friends are killers across sales, writing, YouTube, community building, and strategy.I know world-class advice is just a phone call away.3. Never Compromise Your EthicsIn tough decisions where blurring the lines is an option, choose moral.NEVER compromise your ethics.It'll affect you in subconscious ways you never imagined.4. Be BoringA lot of success comes from just saying no to cheap dopamine.And instead, focusing on the mundane:\u2022 Maximizing sleep\u2022 Guarding time for workouts\u2022 Not eating out in favor of your nutritious dietBoring's not a bad word when you're on the up.5. Become a Self-StarterThe fastest way to grow your career:Find your bosses' pain points and solve them without being asked.You put yourself on the radar - and train your entrepreneurial muscle for when you need it.6. Learn Storytelling EarlySales, hiring, marketing - it's all storytelling.It's the highest intangible ROI skill you can learn.The first step:Study storytelling frameworks and the 7 fundamental human emotions.7. Be HumbleHowever hard it is on your ego, you need to swallow your pride every damn day.It's how you'll take criticism better, know when to ask for help, and know when to cut your losses.Grasping onto an image of who you are only limiting what you might become.8. Never Skip 2 DaysWith whatever habit you're forming, only skip a maximum of one day.Once you skip two in a row, you've lost momentum.I've found this rule much more practical than 'never miss a day'.9. Find Your Peak Energy StateKeep trying new work environments.Experiment with working at different times.Until you find when you're most energetic, at ease, and productive.That's your competitive advantage.10. Embrace CompoundingAim to get 1% better everyday - and be 37x better by the end of the year.It's a simple mindset hack that'll bring you a world of joy down the line.All you need is consistency.11. Never Feel Sorry for YourselfEmbrace the suck and use it as fuel to level up.You're not a victim - don't get in the habit of thinking you are one.That's a surefire way to never achieve anything.It's simple: if you've chosen the wrong road, go back and find the right one.\u2014Enjoy this? \u267b\ufe0f Repost it to your network and followMatt Grayfor more.Want more cheat codes?Join our community of 172,000+ subscribers today:https://lnkd.in/eMB4fWuy\u2026more"

This is particularly important in the workplace.Internally, people with high-functioning depression have the symptoms of a depressive disorder, but can function well in various aspects of life, like work, school, home, and relationships. They have the ability to mask their depression, so others would never recognise it is present.The risk is that sufferers can believe that since they can push through their struggles for a period whilst still being able to achieve at work, that they do not need to seek help.

You talk about how HR drives revenue and market share, not just engagement scores. You think like a business leader who specializes in human capital.2. You turn data into business resultsA 20% turnover spike equals $2M in lost revenue. Dropping engagement leads to 15% lower customer satisfaction. You translate HR metrics into outcomes executives care about.3. You transform policies that slow business downYou cut outdated processes. You shrink 45-day hiring cycles to 15. You remove barriers because every day of bureaucracy costs money.4. You leverage AI but protect human judgmentYou use AI to screen resumes and predict retention but know when human insight matters. You give managers better tools for smarter decisions, not replace them.5. You make culture work through systemsYou build values into compensation, promotions, and performance measures. You create change by rewarding the right behaviors.Being great in HR isn't about policies and procedures.It's about driving business success through people.\u2026more"

        "post_text": "\"AI should not replicate human flaws. It should challenge them.\"As business leaders and beginners venturing into the world of Artificial Intelligence, it's crucial to understand the significance of this quote. AI presents an opportunity not just to automate processes but to enhance them by eliminating biases and inefficiencies inherent in human decision-making.Consider recruitment, for example. Traditional hiring processes can be biased, influenced by unconscious preferences. AI can help create more inclusive work environments by focusing on skills and qualifications rather than subjective judgments. When designed thoughtfully, AI can identify the best candidates based on objective data, thus promoting diversity.In customer service, deploying AI can improve response times and accuracy, providing customers with quick and precise solutions. Unlike humans, AI doesn't get tired or frustrated, which ensures consistent service quality. However, to avoid replicating human flaws like misunderstanding context, AI systems need to be trained with diverse datasets that reflect varied customer interactions.Marketing is another area ripe for AI's transformative power. By analyzing consumer behavior, AI can help craft personalized experiences that resonate more deeply with target audiences. Yet, it's crucial to ensure that these AI systems are free from biases that might marginalize certain groups.To truly harness the potential of AI, we must develop systems that challenge our flawed processes and deliver improved outcomes. This requires a conscious effort to feed AI models with diverse, high-quality data and continuously monitor their outputs for unintended biases.As you begin integrating AI into your business, ask yourself: Is your AI setup challenging existing flaws, or is it inadvertently replicating them? The goal is not just to deploy AI but to do so with a strategic mindset that prioritizes fairness, efficiency, and innovation.P.S.

        "post_text": "\"The ultimate test of AI is whether it makes our lives more human\u2014not less.\"In the quest to integrate AI into business, it's crucial to focus on how technology amplifies the human element. AI should not only streamline operations but also enhance the emotional and creative aspects of work. For beginners, the goal should be to harness AI in ways that promote meaningful connections and nurture innovation.1. Personalization in Customer Experience: AI can analyze customer data to offer personalized experiences. Businesses can cultivate deeper relationships by tailoring products and services to individual preferences. This level of personalization makes interactions feel more human and genuine.2. Automating Routine Tasks: By automating repetitive tasks, AI frees up time for employees to engage in creative problem-solving and strategic thinking. This shift from mundane tasks to meaningful work enables employees to feel more fulfilled and motivated.3. Enhancing Decision-Making: AI can process vast amounts of data quickly, offering insights that inform better business decisions. While AI handles the data crunching, human intuition and empathy are essential for making decisions that consider the broader impact on people and society.4. Facilitating Communication: AI-driven tools can improve communication within a business, whether through chatbots that provide instant customer support or tools that facilitate collaboration across teams. By improving communication, AI helps build stronger, more connected teams.5. Supporting Inclusivity: AI can assist in creating more inclusive workplaces by identifying biases in recruitment processes and suggesting improvements. Ensuring diversity and inclusivity in AI applications reminds us that technology should serve all humans equally.As you explore AI for your business, keep in mind that the most successful implementations are those that enhance the human experience. AI should be a tool that complements and elevates our human capabilities rather than diminishes them.P.S.
